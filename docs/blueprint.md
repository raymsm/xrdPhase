# **App Name**: XRayStruct

## Core Features:

- File Upload: File Upload: Accepts XRD data files in .raw, .rd, .txt, .csv, and .cif formats.
- Pattern Recognition: Pattern Recognition: Utilizes an AI model tool trained on a database of known crystal structures to identify potential matches within the uploaded XRD data. It must reason about the different crystal structures to incorporate in the output.
- Results Display: Results Display: Presents a ranked list of potential crystal structure matches, along with confidence scores and relevant crystallographic information.
- Visualization: Visualization: Generates a basic plot of the XRD data, highlighting the peaks identified by the AI model.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2C3E50) for a professional look.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#ECF0F1) for backgrounds and contrast.
- Accent: Teal (#3498DB) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clear and concise labels for all inputs and outputs.
- Use simple, scientific icons to represent file types and data processing steps.
- Well-organized layout with clear sections for file input, processing, and results display.

## Original User Request:
